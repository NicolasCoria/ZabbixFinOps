A Zabbix frontend module that identifies **underutilized servers** by analyzing historical metrics, helping teams reduce infrastructure costs through data-driven right-sizing recommendations.

##  Features

- **Waste Score & Efficiency Score** — quantifies how much each server is under or well-utilized
- **Growth Trend Detection** — compares first week vs. last week averages to avoid premature downsizing
- **Smart Safeguards** — won't recommend reduction if disk, network or load average are saturated
- **Azure Cost Estimator** — automatically calculates `$ Savings` per month using the Azure Retail Prices API for hosts tagged as `Azure`.
- **Sortable & Filterable Table** — filter by host group, sort by any score column
- **Top 10 Highlight** — visually highlights the most underutilized servers
- **Color-coded Badges** — 🟢 Healthy, 🟡 Moderate, 🔴 High waste at a glance
- **CSV Export** — one-click download for offline analysis or reporting
- **30-day Historical Analysis** — uses Zabbix `trends` tables for efficient queries
- **Right-Sizing Simulation** — suggests concrete vCPU and RAM targets based on P95 usage

## How It Works

The module queries the Zabbix `trends` and `trends_uint` tables for the last 30 days and calculates:

| Metric | Source Item Key |
|--------|----------------|
| CPU utilization (%) | `system.cpu.util` |
| Memory utilization (%) | `vm.memory.utilization` (Linux) / `vm.memory.util` (Windows) or `vm.memory.size[pavailable]` (auto-inverted) |
| Disk usage (%) | `vfs.fs.size[*,pused]` (Automatically tracks all partitions on Linux `/` and Windows `C:`, `D:`, etc., using the highest usage) |
| Network In/Out | `net.if.in` / `net.if.out` |
| Load Average | `system.cpu.load` |

### Waste Score

```
waste_score = 100 - ((cpu_avg + ram_avg) / 2)
```

| Score | Level | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| ≥ 80 |  HIGH | Server is heavily underutilized |
| 60–79 |  MEDIUM | Potential for optimization |
| 40–59 |  LOW | Moderate usage |
| < 40 |  HEALTHY | Well utilized |

### Efficiency Score

```
efficiency_score = (cpu_avg + ram_avg) / 2
```

| Score | Level |
|-------|-------|
| 70–100 | Healthy usage |
| 40–69 | Can be optimized |
| 0–39 | High waste |

### P95 Peak (Percentile 95)

Instead of using the **absolute maximum** (which can be skewed by a single 1-hour spike in 720 hours), the module uses the **95th percentile** of hourly peaks.

```
Example: A server has 720 trend rows (30 days × 24 hours).
P95 ignores the top 5% (36 hours) of highest peaks.
If P95 is still high, it means the server regularly reaches that load — not just a rare spike.
```

The P95 value is calculated by sorting all hourly `value_max` entries ascending and picking the value at position `floor(count × 0.95)`.

| Metric | P95 Threshold | What it means |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| CPU P95 | ≥ 60% | Server regularly hits high CPU — not safe to downsize |
| RAM P95 | ≥ 80% | Server regularly hits high RAM — not safe to downsize |

When P95 peaks are high but averages are low, the module shows: _"Server mostly idle but with periodic load spikes. Investigate spike patterns before downsizing."_

### Detection Rules

A server is flagged as **oversized** only when ALL conditions are met:

- CPU average < 20% **AND** CPU P95 < 60%
- RAM average < 40% **AND** RAM P95 < 80%
- Disk usage is NOT near saturation (< 85%)
- Network is NOT persistently high (< 100 MB/s avg)
- No growth trend projected to exceed thresholds (see below)

If any safeguard triggers, the module explains why reduction is not recommended.

### Trend Analysis

The module compares the **average of week 1** (days 1–7) against the **average of week 4** (days 24–30) to detect workload growth.

**Data quality gate:** Each week must have at least **24 hours** of trend data. If a host was recently added or trend data was purged, the trend shows "N/A" instead of producing misleading results.

**Projection-based blocking:** Instead of blocking on any small increase, the module projects forward:

```
cpu_projected = cpu_avg + cpu_trend
ram_projected = ram_avg + ram_trend
```

Downsizing is only blocked if the projected value **would reach or exceed the threshold** (CPU ≥ 20% or RAM ≥ 40%). This means a server at 5% CPU growing +5pp (projected 10%) is still flagged for reduction, while a server at 15% CPU growing +8pp (projected 23%) is correctly held back.

### Right-Sizing Simulation

Beyond detecting waste, the module suggests **concrete right-sizing targets** — answering the question every manager asks: *"If I reduce, what should I reduce to?"*

**Formula:**

```
recommended = current_allocation × 0.80
```

The module recommends **80% of the current allocation** — directly, without rounding to predefined VM sizes. A safety check ensures the recommendation is never below the server's actual P95 peak usage.

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 1. Read current specs | `system.cpu.num` (vCPUs) and `vm.memory.size[total]` (RAM bytes) |
| 2. Calculate 80% of current | CPU: `floor(current × 0.80)` — RAM: `round(current × 0.80, 1 decimal)` |
| 3. Safety check | Ensure `recommended ≥ P95 actual usage` — if not, no recommendation is made |

**Example:**

| Host | vCPUs | vCPU Rec. | RAM | RAM Rec. |
|------|-------|-----------|-----|----------|
| db-mongo-dev | 4 vCPU | 3 vCPU | 7.5 GB | 6.0 GB |

> A server with 7.5 GB RAM → 80% = **6.0 GB**. P95 RAM usage is 21% (1.57 GB actual) — 6.0 ≥ 1.57, so the recommendation is safe.

**Notes:**
- Recommendations only appear when the suggested size is **smaller** than current (no upsizing suggestions).
- If `system.cpu.num` or `vm.memory.size[total]` items are not available, the columns show "N/A".
- The "—" symbol means no reduction is recommended (current size is already optimal or near-optimal).

**Safeguards:**
- **P95 = 0%** → recommendation is skipped entirely (likely missing or broken data).
- **P95 safety floor** → if 80% of current would be below actual P95 usage, no recommendation is made.
- **Minimum RAM: 2 GB** — the module never recommends less than 2 GB.
- **Minimum vCPU: 1** — the module never recommends less than 1 vCPU.

##  Requirements

- **Zabbix**: 7.0.0 to 7.4.x (tested on 7.4.7)
- **PHP**: 8.0 or higher
- Hosts must be monitored with standard OS templates (Linux by Zabbix Agent, Windows by Zabbix Agent, etc.)
- Trends data must be available (at least 1 hour of collection for trends to populate)
